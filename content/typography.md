##Johannes Cabal the Necromancer

###by Jonathan L. Howard


__Johannes Cabal__ sold his soul years ago in order to learn the laws of necromancy.
Now he wants it back.
Amused and slightly bored, Satan proposes a little _wager_:
Johannes has to persuade one hundred people to sign over their souls or he will be damned forever. This time for real.
Accepting the bargain, Jonathan is given one calendar year and a traveling carnival to complete his task.
With little time to waste, Johannes raises a motley crew from the dead and enlists his brother, _Horst_, a charismatic vampire to help him run his nefarious road show, resulting in mayhem at every turn.



_some of __Jonathan L. Howard__'s books include:_  

* Johannes Cabal the Detective
* Johannes Cabal: The Fear Institute
* The Brothers Cabal
* The Fall of The House of Cabal
